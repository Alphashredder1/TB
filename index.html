        <p class="text-justify">Letters, numbers, and symbols in consistent type-weight and typestyle that make upa complete set (type family) of a distinctive design of printing type such as Ariel, Helvetica,Times Roman and thou- sands others. Most typefaces are available in different typestyles (roman, italic, bold, extrabold, con-densed, etc.) and are chosen for a particular piece of text on the basis of legibility, readability, appropriateness for the audience and the message, reproducibility, and practicality.</p>

    <h3 class="cal">Caligraphic</h3>
        <p class="text-justify">Letters associated with the art of calligraphy and the fonts developed from their production can be classified as calligraphic. Calligraphic letters can be, although do not have to be, classified as Chancery, Etruscan or Uncial. Chancery letters have slightly sloping narrow letters and were influential in the development of serif italics. Etruscan faces do not have lowercase letters and are based on an early form of Roman calligraphy in which the brush was held at a steep angle. The Celtic style, Uncial letters are created from holding the brush at an almost horizontal angle. There is only one case in Uncial designs, although they did become the basis for the development of the roman lower case.</p>

    <h3 class="bla">BLACKLETTER</h3>
      <p class="text-justify">Blackletter typefaces are a script style of calligraphy that were popularized in Germany, although they were used all over Europe from the middle ages through the Renaissance. A highly ornamental style of typgraphy, different styles are often associated with the different regions in which they were developed and used. The main classifications include Textura, Schwabacher, Cursiva and Fraktur. Textura is the most closely related to the calligraphic style and often includes a large number of ligatures. Schwabacher typefaces have a simplified, rounded stroke and several of their lowercaseletters including ‘o’, are often analogous forms. Cursiva, as the name suggests, is closely related to cursive letters and  can be recognized by the more frequent presenc of descenders and looped ascenders. Fraktur is the most common form of Blackletter and is characterized by broken strokes.</p>

    <div class="medium-12 column pad">
      <p class="text-justify"> Serifed typefaces were popular much earlier than sans serif typefaces and include semi-structural details on many of the letters. People often refer to them as feet, although that is in no way a proper anatomical term when referring to typography. Their are many different classifications for serifed typeface, often named for their origins, including Grecian, Latin, Scotch, Scotch Modern, French Old Style, Spanish Old Style, Clarendon and Tuscan. Some of these classifications can also be placed into broader classifications of typography including the styles below.</p>

      <p> The Old Style or Humanist serif typefaces developed in the 15th and 16th centuries and are characterizedby a low contrast in stroke weight and angled serifs.</p>

      <h3>Modern</h3>
      <p>Modern serifed typefaces developed in the late 18th and early 19th century and were a radical break from the traditional typography of the time with high contrast of strokes, straight serifs and a totally vertical axis. Example: Bodoni.</p>

      <p>Egyptian, or slab-serifed, typefaces have heavy serifs and were used for decorative purposes and headlines because the heavy serifs impeded legibility at small point sizes. </p>

      <h3>Script</h3>
        <p>Script typefaces are based on the forms made with a flexible brush or pen and often have variedstrokes reminiscent of handwriting. There are many different classifications including Brush Script, English Roundhand and Rationalized Script. However, the broadest forms of classification are Formal Script and Casual Script.
      </p>
      </div>

      <div class="medium-6 column">
        <p class="p">
        Formal Scripts are based on the developments and writings of 17th and 18th century handwriting masters such as George Bickham, George Shelley and George Snell. Casual scripts developed in the 20th century as a result of photo-typesetting and are more varied and the inconsistencies appear to have been a result of using a wet pen rather than a pen nib.</p>

        <p>Pixel fonts developed from the invention of the computer and were based on the on-screen display format of pixels. They are based on an array of pixels, are often called Bitmap fonts and are often designed only for a specific point size. Many type foundries offer a selection of bitmap fonts and some, like Fonts For Flash create only bitmap fonts.</p>

      <div class="medium-6 column">
        <h3>Decorative</h3>
        <p>While serifed and sans-serif typefaces can often be used for text typesetting, there are a vast majority of fonts and typefaces whose legibility wanes when used in smaller point sizes. These typefaces are often developed with a specific use in mind and are designed for larger point size use in headlines, posters and billboards. Decorative is less of a classification and can include a wide variety of typefaces underneath the umbrella of the term.</p>
